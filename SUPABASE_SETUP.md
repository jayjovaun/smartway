# 🚀 Supabase Storage Setup & Deployment Guide

## ✅ Current Status

**✅ COMPLETED MIGRATION:**
- ✅ Firebase completely removed
- ✅ Supabase Storage integration - **READY**
- ✅ Vercel deployment compatibility - **READY**
- ✅ TypeScript compilation - **WORKING**
- ✅ Build process - **WORKING**
- ✅ Text input functionality - **WORKING**

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Supabase Project Setup

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New project"
3. Choose your organization → Enter project name → Database password → Choose region → Create project
4. Wait for project initialization (usually 1-2 minutes)
5. Navigate to **Storage** in the sidebar
6. Click "Create a new bucket"
7. Enter bucket name: `uploads`
8. Make it **Public** (check the "Public bucket" option)
9. Click "Create bucket"

### 2. Get Supabase Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** → **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy the **Project URL** (e.g., `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`)
3. Copy the **Anon/Public Key** (starts with `eyJ...`)

### 3. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file and Vercel environment variables:

```env
# Required: Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Required: Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Optional: Server Configuration
PORT=3001
```

### 4. Configure Storage Policies (Important!)

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to **Storage** → **Policies**
2. For the `uploads` bucket, add these policies:

**Policy 1: Allow public uploads**
```sql
-- Name: Allow public uploads
-- Policy: INSERT
-- Target roles: public
-- Using expression:
true

-- With check:
bucket_id = 'uploads'
```

**Policy 2: Allow public downloads**
```sql
-- Name: Allow public downloads  
-- Policy: SELECT
-- Target roles: public
-- Using expression:
bucket_id = 'uploads'
```

Or use the simplified approach:
1. Go to **Storage** → **Buckets**
2. Click on your `uploads` bucket
3. Go to **Policies** tab
4. Click "Add policy" → "Get started quickly"
5. Choose "Enable read access for all users" and "Enable insert access for all users"

### 5. Local Testing

```bash
# Start development server
npm run start:dev

# In another terminal, test functionality
npm run dev

# Open browser: http://localhost:5173
```

### 6. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod

# Or use Vercel dashboard:
# 1. Connect your GitHub repo
# 2. Add environment variables
# 3. Deploy
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Text Input Flow
```
User types text → InputForm → AppPage → /api/generate → 
Gemini AI → Study pack generated ✅
```

### File Upload Flow
```
User drops file → FileDropUpload → Supabase Storage → 
URL sent to AppPage → /api/generate → Download from Supabase → 
Extract text → Gemini AI → Study pack generated ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Local Development
- [ ] Text input generates study pack
- [ ] File upload works with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Supabase Storage shows uploaded files
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Files are publicly accessible via URL

### Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Text input works on deployed URL
- [ ] File upload works on deployed URL
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
→ Check environment variables are set with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix

**"File upload fails"**
→ Verify Supabase bucket policies allow public uploads

**"Policy violation" error**
→ Make sure storage policies are configured correctly (see step 4)

**"Text input 500 error"**
→ Check Gemini API key is valid and properly set

**"Build fails"**
→ Run `npm install` and check for TypeScript errors

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check environment variables
node -e "console.log(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY ? 'API Key Set' : 'Missing API Key')"

# Test Supabase config
node -e "console.log(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL)"

# Test build
npm run build

# Test server
npm run start:dev
```
